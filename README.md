## Features
* Logos
	* Syntax Highlighting
	* Native File Formatter
* Objective C/C++
	* Support for Formatting
## Formatter
The formatter is powered by the **'clang-format'** executable included with LLVM. Simply enabling the format options in the *Logos* section of your preferences will allow you to format your documents.
The configuration requires that you link the path to your **'clang-format'** executable, however the default value assumes that it is in your path.
